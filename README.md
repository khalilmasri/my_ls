Dear user:

my_ls terminal command is a re-creation of UNIX ls.

Inside these files, you could see how the ls command works but in a modified way.

I will keep all files and not use .gitignore for you to experiment and have a look at the code that I used, also I'm leaving 
2 directories for you ("dir1", "dir2"), this 2 directories has some hidden files.

To start using you will have to make a file, so let's start 1 step at a time:
1- Use the command "Make" in ssh terminal without quotes.
2- run the command ./my_ls and use. .. dir1 dir2
3- We have applied some special characters that need to be followed after "-"
    examples:
        -t for sorting the files by modification time.
        -a for displaying the hidden files.
    You could also use both in any order you like
        examples:
            -ta for a combination of -t -a 
4- Just experiment and have fun.

**DON'T FORGET TO CLEAN** use the command make clean

Remember User coding is fun and amazing.

Kind regards,
my_ls developer# my_ls
